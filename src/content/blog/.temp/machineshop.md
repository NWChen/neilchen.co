When I was in college, I spent a year on and off [building things with my hands for fun](http://neilchen.co/post/2017/01/01/building-a-t-shirt-shooting-robot/). The way I did that was generally by misappropriating study time and instead spending it in the `machine shop`. It's a place where:

1. people build different things
2. people see each other build different things, and ask what they're working on & why they're working on it
3. people broadcast feedback and advice on the things other people were building

The `machine shop` was a community uniquely tailored to encouraging __friendcatching__ in the lowest-resistance way.
