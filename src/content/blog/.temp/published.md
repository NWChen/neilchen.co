It's published! For several months in college I worked with Professor Hod Lipson's [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/) on building a "soft actuator". The goal was to build an electrically-powered "muscle" geometry out of silicone; our approach was to drive contraction and expansion thermally. <!--more--> [*Improving the Actuation Characteristics of Silicone/Ethanol Soft Actuators*](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0825/9/3/62) is now published in MDPI thanks to:
